A simple way to wrap a system command and add or enhance functionality, Requiring minimal setup and using a clear and simple directory structure to add scripts.

== Install ==

To setup add <INSTALL PATH>/init to your bash init. This will create aliases for all sub-directories, at the moment the example are svn and ls. 

== Types ==

Command adaptor: Wraps a single command, like "ls", allowing you to add new options or add to output.

Sub-command adaptor: Wraps a command with sub-commands, such as svn, allowing you to add new sub-commands locally.

== Warning ==

This is still a work in progress and needs some more re-factoring before it's ready for anyone else to use properly.

You should only add, never change, existing command functionality. Otherwise you'll likely break things relying on normal unix behavior. Don't be a dick.
